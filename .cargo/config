# Opt out of the local time zone offset safety mess on Unix. The program
# does not mutate its environment, so we do not run risk of unsafety. We
# do, however, run in a multi-threaded setting when executing tests, so
# without this setting the underlying safe guard in the time crate
# prevents us from running properly.
# We could work with UTC times conceptually, but that's a no-go from a
# user-experience perspective.
